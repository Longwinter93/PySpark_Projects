# PySpark_Project4_PizzaRestaurant 
# INTRODUCTION
<br>Pizza is one of the most favourite meals in the world.<br>A pizza restaurant serves a various kind of pizza to customers.<br> The menu and services of the pizza restaurant was analyzed by using ***Apache Spark***.
<br>***Spark*** is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in _Scala, Java, Python and R_.

<br> **This analysis was performed to find out about the quantity of pizza that was ordered, the sales amount of pizza  and other interesting details about the restaurant and its services at a given time**
# ANALYSIS
<br>Analysis was perfomed by **PySpark**. **PySpar**k is the **Python API** for _Apache Spark_. 
<br>***Advanced functions for ETL/ELT transformations were used to create this project.***
<br>Before analysis, data was cleaned using advanced **PySpark functions & methods**
<br>All steps with detailed information is also described in [PySpark_Project4_PizzaRestaurant.ipynb](https://github.com/Longwinter93/PySpark_Projects/blob/main/PySpark_Project4_PizzaRestaurant/PySpark_Project4_PizzaRestaurant.ipynb)
