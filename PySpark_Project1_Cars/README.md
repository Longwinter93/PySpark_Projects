# PySpark_Project1_Cars
# INTRODUCTION 
Cars from four markets (Argentina, Nigeria, USA and Poland) were analyzed by using ***Apache Spark***.
***Spark*** is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in _Scala, Java, Python and R_.
It also supports ***pandas API on Spark*** for _pandas workloads_.
<br> **This analysis was performed to find out about  which cars are the most expensive, which ones are the least expensive, how many kilometers each car drives, which type of fuel type and other vehicles properties cars have from these markets.**
# ANALYSIS
Analysis was perfomed by **PySpark**. **PySpar**k is the **Python API** for _Apache Spark_. ***Advanced functions for ETL/ELT transformations were used to create this project.***
<br>Before analysis, data was cleaned using advanced **PySpark functions & methods**
<br>All steps with detailed information is also described in [PySpark_Project1_Cars.ipynb](https://github.com/Longwinter93/PySpark_Projects/blob/main/PySpark_Project1_Cars/PySpark_Project1_Cars.ipynb)
