# PySpark_Project2_Lego
# INTRODUCTION 
<br>Inventory that stores goods that are related to Lego  was  analyzed by using ***Apache Spark***.
<br>***Spark*** is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in _Scala, Java, Python and R_.
<br>It also supports ***pandas API on Spark*** for _pandas workloads_.
<br> **This analysis was performed to find out about quantity of items, parts, sets and themes and their properties for example either colours or transparent and the stock of these parts in the inventory.**
# ANALYSIS
<br>Analysis was perfomed by **PySpark**. **PySpar**k is the **Python API** for _Apache Spark_. 
<br>***Advanced functions for ETL/ELT transformations were used to create this project.***
<br>Before analysis, data was cleaned using advanced **PySpark functions & methods**
<br>All steps with detailed information is also described in [PySpark_Project2_Lego.ipynb](https://github.com/Longwinter93/PySpark_Projects/blob/main/PySpark_Project2_Lego/PySpark_Project2_Lego.ipynb)
